Tallgrass Energy GP, LP: 30%+ Distribution Growth This Year With No K-1 Hassle
An accelerated drop-down of another 25% interest in the REX Pipeline will power distribution growth later this year.

Meantime, a $150 million payment to REX from a bankruptcy settlement is also a positive catalyst.

TEGP's distribution growth rate is expected to be 50% higher than TEP's growth rate this year.

TEGP currently yields 4% and issues a 1099, so there is no K-1 filing hassle at tax time.
Tallgrass Energy GP, LP (NYSE:TEGP) is a limited partnership that includes operations of Tallgrass Equity, LLC and Tallgrass Energy Partners, LP (NYSE:TEP). TEP operates in three segments: crude oil pipelines, natural gas pipelines, and natural gas processing and logistics. Since its IPO in May of 2015, TEGP has more than doubled annual distributions (from $0.53 at the IPO to $1.11 as of Q4 FY16). Based on its ownership interests in TEP, the outlook for continued distribution growth is excellent. In addition, investors looking to participate in the domestic midstream sector without the hassles of filing a K-1 at tax time will be glad to know TEGP elected to be treated as a corporation for tax purposes. As a result, TEGP issues a 1099 instead of a K-1.
As the graphic above shows, Tallgrass Energy GP,LP has no assets other than its controlling interest in Tallgrass Equity, LLC - which owns 20 million TEP units, all of the GP interest in TEP, and 100% of the incentive distribution rights ("IDRs") in TEP.
