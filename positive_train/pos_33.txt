Toshiba Tec Shares Rise More Than 6 Percent on Sale Report
TOKYO â€” Shares in Toshiba Tec Corp rose more than 6 percent in early Monday trading after a report that Toshiba Corp, the parent, is considering selling shares in the company.

Toshiba Corp denied a Nikkei business daily report that it was looking to sell shares in Toshiba Tec, a maker of cash register systems, as it seeks to plug an upcoming $6.3 billion writedown for its U.S. nuclear unit.

Toshiba has selected an advisory firm to help find a buyer soon for Toshiba Tec, the paper said. The sale price for the entire 50.02 percent stake in Toshiba Tec would likely be around 100 billion yen ($870 million), the Nikkei said.

Toshiba Tec shares were trading at 645 yen, up 5.2 percent from Friday's close, as of 2420 GMT (8:20 p.m. ET).

Toshiba is in the middle of the process of selling a majority or all of its stake in the flagship memory chips unit, the world's second-biggest NAND chip producer, which it vales at at least $13 billion.

Earlier this month Toshiba sold almost all of its stake in affiliate Toshiba Machine Co for $134 million to raise cash.
