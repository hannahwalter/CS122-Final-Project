Pfizer reported a 25 percent increase in its second-quarter net income on Tuesday because of aggressive cost-cutting and lower reorganizing and other charges, shaking off the expected plunge in revenue from generic competition to its cholesterol fighter Lipitor, the world’s top-selling drug.

The world’s biggest drug maker easily beat analysts’ expectations, and Pfizer’s stock hit a 52-week closing high of $24.06, up 35 cents.

Pfizer, which makes Viagra and the painkiller Celebrex among other drugs, posted net income of $3.25 billion, or 43 cents a share, in the latest quarter, up from $2.61 billion, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier.

Excluding $2.1 billion in charges before taxes, adjusted net income was $4.67 billion, or 62 cents a share — 8 cents more than Wall Street expected. Charges included $1.2 billion for asset write-downs and $474 million in legal charges, mainly for litigation over its hormone replacement medicines.

Revenue totaled $15.06 billion, down 9 percent but above expectations of $14.93 billion.

Timothy Anderson, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, wrote to investors that Pfizer’s strong profit was primarily a result of better revenue, better gross margins and lower selling, general and administrative spending. Pfizer has reduced its work force to 101,000, from about 110,600 people at the end of 2010.

Generic competition reduced sales by about $1.8 billion, mainly because the patent for Lipitor, which had peak annual global sales of $13 billion, expired in November. Early sales losses to two generic versions were slowed by Pfizer’s campaign to keep patients on its brand as long as possible.

Prescription plans got huge rebates to exclusively cover Lipitor and patients got discount cards to buy the pills for a $4 monthly co-payment. The insurer rebates stopped on May 30, when several more generic versions flooded the market. Prices plunged from about $175 a month for Lipitor to about $15 for generics.

During the quarter, Lipitor sales in the United States dropped to $296 million from $1.4 billion a year earlier. Global sales slumped 53 percent, to $1.22 billion.

Still, “We kept three times more share than has traditionally occurred” after a big drug’s patent expired, Pfizer’s chief executive, Ian C. Read, said in an interview. “We added hundreds of millions of dollars of profitability to the company, as well as enabling patients to stay on the brand.”

Sales of newer drugs, particularly the pain reliever Lyrica and Prevnar 13, a vaccine against ear infections, meningitis and other bacterial diseases, rose just over 10 percent. Lyrica sales hit $1.04 billion and Prevnar 13 totaled $916 million.

Total pharmaceutical sales fell 10 percent, to $13.14 billion.
